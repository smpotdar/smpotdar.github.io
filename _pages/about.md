I am a Research Assistant in Prof. Katerina Fragidiaki's lab at the Machine Learning Deparment in Carnegie Mellon University.

#### Research Interest:
Broadly, I am interested in solving hard problems in Computer Vision using tools from various fields like Machine Learning, Statistics and Geometry. Specifically, I like to work on unsupervised and supervised long term tracking of objects, object detection and recognition. I also like to work on SLAM based projects and camera calibration.

#### Previously:
I was a Master's student in CMU's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department where I had a chance to work in Prof. Mario Saviddes's lab on fine grain object classification. During my Master's I also had the pleasure of working with Prof. Zachary Lipton on efficient neural machine language translation.
